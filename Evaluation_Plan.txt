        *** Relevance-Based Ranking Algorithm & SympGraph ***
1. The articles returned in the UI are indexed based on the relevance of article. So, the user gets the most relevant articles than random articles.
2. The symptoms filters generated in the UI even though based on fetched articles, takes into account the co-occurrence between different symptoms and only highly correlated symptoms based on the SympGraph weights is displayed.
3. Due to the need of symptom-symptom weight pair in a csv file, the system needs to lookup the correlation between symptoms each time the system retrieves articles, which is an overhead.
